Unfinished C++ Game Jam Project

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bad2a47-c19f-4a8b-b535-949c946a74e5)

This repository hosts the code for my very first game, developed entirely from scratch in C++ as part of a game jam!
üéÆ About The Game

This project was an exciting learning experience, marking my debut in game development using C++. It was originally built for macOS using a Makefile, but later I had to adapt the release process for Windows, which introduced me to the world of CMake ‚Äì a real learning curve!

The core mechanics and base framework are in place, but there are still many features I plan to add to bring the game to its full potential.
‚ú® Features (Current)

    Basic character movement

    Inventory system

    Item pickup from the ground

    Item dropping from inventory

üöß Features (Planned)

    Proper in-game quit mechanism (currently Alt-F4 on Windows)

    A definitive endgame or victory condition

    Further features to be detailed soon!
